# Backup-Solid-State-Drive-for-Ransomware-Protection

This is a Backup Based Project whose main advantage is Automatic Backup.

In Manual Backup, we have to specify source and destination folders from wherewe have to take the files and store the files.After Completion of both Manual and Automatic Backup we receive notification on E-mail. We can also Encrypt and Decrypt our files to provide extra security.
